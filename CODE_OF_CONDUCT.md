## The Actual Code of Conduct

1. Don't be an asshole.

That's pretty much it.

## Lots of Words and Other Stuff

> [!TIP]
> Read this bit too. It actually elaborates, unlike the code of conduct.

Everyone here is a volunteer and is not getting paid for their time (unless
they are, idk). Bullying, harassment, douchebaggery, etc is counterproductive
to encouraging contributions. This is an open source project, the only way for
it to grow is through contributions. Also just don't be an asshole generally.

If you see any harassment, bullying or consistent, seriously offensive and/or
in appropriate behaviour, let the person know. If they don't stop, raise the
issue with a maintainer. We want everyone to have a good time and not feel put
off from making their thoughts on an issue or PR known.

If you see someone being a bit insensitive, please don't start a war. Cultural
and language barriers exist, so please just try to ignore any mildly offensive
parts and focus on the intent of the message (i.e. the bug if it's a bug
report). If you feel as though you have to do something about it, it's ok to
let them know that you feel they are being insensitive, but again, don't start
a war.

Also please try to stay on topic in issues, PRs, discussions and anything else
really.

Most of all, if people fail to adhere to this document or the spirit of its
content, remember the magic words.
