## Reporting Bugs

If you've found a bug, please open an issue on GitHub.

### Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

The best way to report a security vulnerability is through GitHub's security
page. This allows us to privately try to diagnose and fix the vulnerability. We
would appreciate it if you do NOT open a regular issue for this purpose.

## Docs

If you want to contribute to the docs, please open a pull request. If you are
unsure of anything, you can either ask by commenting on said PR, or by
opening/commenting on a related issue.

## Code

If you want to contribute any code, whether it is to fix bugs or add features,
we would appreciate it if there is an existing issue for the problem. This
allows us to use issues to track bugs and feature requests, without having to
sort through PRs.

If you have already submitted a PR, don't worry, we won't block anyone's pull
request just because it doesn't have an associated issue. (Also, it's not too
late to create an issue :).)

## Whitespace fixes, code style changes, etc

If your PR is entirely or mostly cosmetic code changes, we most likely won't
accept it. I think the explanation given here is incredibly good
https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/13771#issuecomment-32746700. If you find
this kind of problem, please either open an issue about it or mention it in one
such existing issue.

## Something Else?

If there's anything that isn't covered here, the general process for
contributing should be something along the lines of:
1. Open an issue about it
2. Figure out what to do next with a maintainer or whoever
3. Pull Request?
