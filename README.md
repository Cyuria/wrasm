# wrasm

wrasm is a risc-V assembler, primarily targeting riscv64.

The assembler is currently under development, but is planned to have the
following features:
- Full support for GNU assembler features
- A powerful, turing complete preprocessor inspired by nasm
- Cross platform support for windows, linux and macOS (currently only windows
and x86_64 linux have been tested)
- Binaries for many if not all supported platforms
